%\begin{abstract}
%
%In the past few years, significant progress has been made on the problem of
%instance recognition, in which a vision system must estimate the identity and
%pose of an object from a database of object instances. However, for many
%robotics purposes, such a system needs to be nearly perfect to work in the real
%world.  The state of the art in computer vision has rapidly advanced over the
%past decade largely due to the advent of fundamental image datasets such as
%MNIST, Caltech-101, PASCAL, and ImageNet.  However, these datasets are usually
%geared towards image retrieval tasks, as they often contain assorted collections
%of images from the web that do not enable pose recovery.  Furthermore, they do
%not examine what can actually be solved today by computer vision for robotic
%perception.  To address these issues, we present a high-quality,
%large-scale dataset of 3D object instances, with accurate calibration
%information for every image. We anticipate that ``solving'' this dataset will
%effectively remove many perception-related problems for mobile, sensing-based
%robots.
%
%While there exist several 3D datasets (e.g. Willow Garage, NYU V2,
%RGB-D Object Dataset, B3DO), they either only contain contain a small
%number of moderate-quality object models and/or scenes, lack some of the
%information a robot might have (such as calibration), or lack instance-level
%data.  We present four contributions: (1) a dataset of 100 objects (and
%growing), composed of 600 3D point clouds and 600 high-resolution (12 MP)
%images spanning all views of each object, (2) a bundle adjustment method for
%calibrating a multi-sensor system, (3) details of our data collection system,
%which collects all required data for a single object in under 6 minutes with
%minimal human effort, and (4) multiple software components, used to automate
%multi-sensor calibration and simplify the data collection process.
